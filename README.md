# CS4375_Portfolio
This is a portfolio for my CS 4375 (Machine Learning) class.

## Portfolio Assignment: Getting Started (Assignment 0)
This is our intro assignment.

You can access the paper [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%200/Overview_of_ML_Aarya_Patil.pdf).

## Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration (Assignment 1)
This is our first assignment. We had to code statistical functions from R in C++ and apply them to a CSV file.

You can access my code [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%201/main.cpp) and the document explaining it more in depth [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%201/Assignment_1_Data_Exploration_Explanation.pdf).

## Portfolio: Linear Models (Assignment 2)
This is our second assignment. We had to work with a partner to generate Regression and Classification RMD notebooks using 2 datasets of our choice. 

You can access our RMD notebook for Regression [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%202/ML_Regression.pdf) and the one for Classification [here] (https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%202/ML_Classification.pdf).

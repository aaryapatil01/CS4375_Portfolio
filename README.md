# CS4375_Portfolio
This is a portfolio for my CS 4375 (Machine Learning) class.

## Portfolio Assignment: Getting Started (Assignment 0)
This is our intro assignment.

You can access the paper [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%200/Overview_of_ML_Aarya_Patil.pdf).

## Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration (Assignment 1)
This is our first assignment. We had to code statistical functions from R in C++ and apply them to a CSV file.

You can access my code [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%201/main.cpp) and the document explaining it more in depth [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%201/Assignment_1_Data_Exploration_Explanation.pdf).

## Portfolio: Linear Models (Assignment 2)
This is our second assignment. We had to work with a partner to generate Regression and Classification RMD notebooks using 2 datasets of our choice. 

You can access our RMD notebook for Regression [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%202/ML_Regression.pdf) and the one for Classification [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%202/ML_Classification.pdf).

## Portfolio Component: ML Algorithms from Scratch (Assignment 3)
This is our third assignment. We had to work with a partner to create 2 ML algorthims from scratch in C++. 

You can access our code for the logistic regression algorithm [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%203/Logistic_Regression.cpp) and the code for the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%203/Naive_Bayes.cpp). You can access the document containing the output and analysis of the program [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%203/ML_Algorithms_From_Scratch.pdf).


## Portfolio Component: Searching for Similarity (Assignment 4)
This is our fourth assignment. We worked in our groups and picked individual parts to complete from the project. I had the task of performing the following regression algorithms on a dataset of my choice: Linear regression, kNN regression, and Decision tree regression. 

You can access my RMD notebook [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4375_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%204/Similarity_and_Ensemble_Regression.pdf).

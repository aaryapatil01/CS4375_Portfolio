# Summary

I really enjoyed taking ML this semester with Professor Mazidi. I got to learn a large variety of ML techniques, which I plan on using in future projects as well as in any future employment opportunities. I have always had an interest in ML, so getting to really understand how it works was very exciting for me. I know that this is a rapidly changing field, so I plan on taking online courses and reading about any new advancements to stay up-to-date with the information.
